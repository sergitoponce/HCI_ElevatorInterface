HCI Homework 1

Section C:

The elevator I chose is the one located in the Library.

My first problem with this interface is the layout of the buttons. As you can see, the buttons are ordered from left to right, going upwards. I believe this is an issue because the buttons should be ordered from bottom to top, increasing, instead of from left to right. There are not many buttons on this interface, so ordering it in this way should not be a problem and it will make it more clear for the user.


Section B:

Common uses: Elevators are commonly used for going up and down floors in a building, sometimes multiple floors at a time. An interface allows us to make this process easier by having a simple, responsive interface where all the user has to do is look at the list of floors in the building and make a decision on which floor the user would like to go to.

User interaction: A common sequence of actions that a user does is simple. First, the user will want to select if they want to go up or down in floors. When the elevator arrives and the doors open, the user will then walk into the elevator, look at the list of floors, and select which floor they would like to go to.

Elevator feedback:

Common mistakes with current design: Language barrier may keep someone from reaching the bottom floor since there are two button on the bottom row?

Improvements: Redesign the button layout to where instead of going left to right, the buttons are in a single column going from the bottom to the top, where the floor number is increasing.
