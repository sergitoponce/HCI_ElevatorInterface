The elevator I chose is the one located in the Library.

My first problem with this interface is the layout of the buttons. As you can see, the buttons are ordered from left to right, going upwards. This is an issue because it is hard for the user to tell which floor is the very bottom floor and which floor is the very top floor. I believe this can be fixed if the buttons can be ordered from bottom to top, increasing, instead of from left to right. There are not many buttons on this interface, so ordering it in this way should not be a problem and it will make it more clear for the user.


### Section B:

Common uses: 
Elevators are commonly used for going up and down floors in a building, sometimes multiple floors at a time. An interface allows us to make this process easier by having a simple, responsive interface where all the user has to do is look at the list of floors in the building and make a decision on which floor the user would like to go to.

User interaction: 
A common sequence of actions that a user does is simple. First, the user will want to select if they want to go up or down in floors. When the elevator arrives and the doors open, the user will then walk into the elevator, look at the list of floors, and select which floor they would like to go to. After selecting a floor the user will go to indicated floor.

Elevator support: 
The elevator can provide support through the floor descriptions that are written next to the buttons. In my example, you can see that next to each button there is a description of the floor you are going to, i.e. Floor 2 has the 3D animation lab. The elevator also provides support to the user by having a button for the alarm and a button to call for help.

Elevator feedback: 
The elevator provides feedback to the user in various ways. First, the button you press will light up showing the user that a floor has been selected. The user can select multiple floors, and each floor that is selected will light up indicating that the elevator will travel to that floor. Second, the elevator provides feedback by playing a sound when the user arrives to a floor.

Common mistakes with current design: 
Language barrier may keep someone from reaching the bottom floor since there are two button on the bottom row. If someone doesn't know what floor B or floor G is, then they will not know which floor is the bottom floor with the current layout. Also, if you press the wrong floor by accident, there is no way to back out of the selection.

Improvements: 
Redesign the button layout to where instead of going left to right, the buttons are in a single column going from the bottom to the top, where the floor number is increasing. This will make it easier for the user to tell which is the very bottom floor and which is the very top floor. Here is my sketch.
